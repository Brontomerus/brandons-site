I'm currently 25 years old, grew up near Cleveland, Ohio, and I'm always trying to learn & try new things. My career interests are focused on working with companies to fully leverage cloud architectures and machine learning to translate _predictive analytics_ into _prescriptive analytics_. I love to learn and challenge myself, and I like to work with Python and Databases of all shapes, sizes, and theorems. Whether its the ACID Principles or the CAP theorem, Regression or Classification, Supervised or Unsupervised - I'm all about learning how it works and how it fits into the grand scheme of the data analytics stack!\n\n\n# Personal Mission Statement:\n\n_I, __Brandon Donelan__, strive to be courageous, compassionate, and virtuous in all facets of life; respecting that continuous self-improvement and continous learning are catalysts for achieving great things in one's lifetime. I aim to be a source of strength for those in need, a source of love for those I'm close with, to always stand up for whats right, to always put forth the best effort I can muster, and __to the best I can be__._\n\n\n\n# Currently\n\nI specialize in designing, building, and leveraging systems that drive intelligent decisions using an organization's data. Whether in Business Intelligence or Data Science, I enjoy working with data to make measurable, tangible impacts on the company in which I work for.\n\nAt the moment, I work as an Analytics Data Engineer at [RevSpring](https://revspringinc.com/), working in the healthcare RCM space.

I attended the wonderful public schools there, and graduated from Strongsville High School in the class of 2014. While growing up, I enjoyed athletics and was involved in both football and baseball throughout most of my childhood and was able to pursue that because of the support from my wonderful parents, Tom and Ginny. I have 2 older siblings, a brother named Connor and a sister named Emmie. As the youngest of three, perhaps my greatest feat was still being my parents favorite despite the long odds. \n\n\n\n# I like\n\n- My wonderful girlfriend, [Summer Nairn](https://summer-nairn.com)\n- Learning and generally being curious about things\n- Machine Learning\n- Space \n     - I even have a tattoo of the pulsar map on Voyager spacecraft, the only man-made object to exit our solar system's heliosphere, becoming the first human-made object to enter \u2013 and measure \u2013 interstellar space.\n- Entertainment:\n     - Cleveland Browns football (yes, even at the darkest of hours: Billy Manziel, going 0-16, and even drafting 29-year-old Brandon Weeden in the 1st round)\n     - NASCAR - Favorite Cars are the #12 Penske car and #21 Wood Brothers Racing car\n- Activities:\n     - Snowboarding\n     - Running & Weight Training\n     - Hiking\n     - Reading\n- Favorite Video Games:\n     - [Shake It Up!
