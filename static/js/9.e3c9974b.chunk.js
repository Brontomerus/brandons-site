I love to learn and am driven by my tremendous curiousity to learn and know more. I have a thirst more knowledge and with the tools available all over the internet I have tried to take full advantage of learning whatever I can, whenever I can.\n\n\n# Currently\n\nCurrently, I work as an Analytics Data Engineer at [RevSpring](https://revspringinc.com/), working in the healthcare RCM space. I also work for [Deck of Dice Gaming](https://www.shakeitupdice.com/) in my spare time, and serve as Director of Analytics, supporting both real-time and server-based analytics for their mobile applications.\n\n\n# Some history\n\nI grew up in [Strongsville, Ohio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Strongsville,+OH), which is a suburb directly southwest of Cleveland, Ohio. I attended the wonderful public schools there, and graduated from Strongsville High School in the class of 2014. While growing up, I enjoyed athletics and was involved in both football and baseball throughout most of my childhood and was able to pursue that because of the support from my wonderful parents, Tom and Ginny. I have 2 older siblings, a brother named Connor and a sister named Emmie. As the youngest of three, perhaps my greatest feat was still being my parents favorite despite the long odds (Any other youngest childern out there will understand that joke). \n\n\n# I like\n\n- My wonderful girlfriend, [Summer Nairn](summer-nairn.com)\n- Cleveland Browns football (yes, even when they were 1-31 over a 3 year span...)\n- NASCAR - Favorite Cars are the #12 and #21\n- Learning and generally being curious about things\n- Running & Weight Training\n- Machine Learning\n- Space\n- Snowboarding\n- Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (only the real know)\n\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I can speak some Czech, or better said, J\xe1 um\xedm mluvit trochu \u010cesky.\n- I have never been able to spell "license" correctly without verifying via spellcheck or google.\n- I have a mullet, because 2020.\n- I have a cat named Cookie. He is a ~6 year old tabby rescue, and follows me around everywhere. Kind of like a furry parrot that can only meow.\n\n\n# I dream of\n\n- I dream of one day opening an animal shelter.\n- Making the world a better place.\n- Always helping others.\n- Running my own company one day.\n',c=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(t.jsx)(r.b,Object(o.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(t.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Brandon Donelan",children:Object(t.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(t.jsx)("header",{children:Object(t.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(t.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(t.jsx)(r.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(t.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",c," words)"]})]})}),Object(t.jsx)(s.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
