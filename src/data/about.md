# Intro

I have a passion to work with data because I think the continous change and growth in this field makes it an absolutely fascinating work environment. I love to learn and am driven by my tremendous curiousity to learn and know more. I have a thirst more knowledge and with the tools available all over the internet I have tried to take full advantage of learning whatever I can, whenever I can.


# Currently

Currently, I work as an Analytics Data Engineer at [RevSpring](https://revspringinc.com/), working in the healthcare RCM space. I also work for [Deck of Dice Gaming](https://www.shakeitupdice.com/) in my spare time, and serve as Director of Analytics, supporting both real-time and server-based analytics for their mobile applications.


# Some history

I grew up in [Strongsville, Ohio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Strongsville,+OH), which is a suburb directly southwest of Cleveland, Ohio. I attended the wonderful public schools there, and graduated from Strongsville High School in the class of 2014. While growing up, I enjoyed athletics and was involved in both football and baseball throughout most of my childhood and was able to pursue that because of the support from my wonderful parents, Tom and Ginny. I have 2 older siblings, a brother named Connor and a sister named Emmie. As the youngest of three, perhaps my greatest feat was still being my parents favorite despite the long odds (Any other youngest childern out there will understand that joke).
