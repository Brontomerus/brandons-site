# Intro

I'm Brandon. I'm currently 25 years old, grew up near Cleveland, Ohio, and I'm always trying to learn & try new things. My career interests are focused on working with companies to fully leverage cloud architectures and machine learning to translate _predictive analytics_ into _prescriptive analytics_. I love to learn and challenge myself, and I like to work with Python and Databases of all shapes, sizes, and theorems. Whether its the ACID Principles or the CAP theorm, Regression or Classification, Supervised or Unsupervised - I'm all about learning how it works and how it fits into the grand scheme of the data analytics stack!


# Personal Mission Statement:

_I, __Brandon Donelan__, strive to be courageous, compassionate, and virtuous in all facets of life; respecting that continuous self-improvement and continous learning are catalysts for achieving great things in one's lifetime. I aim to be a source of strength for those in need, a source of love for those I'm close with, to always stand up for whats right, to always put forth the best effort I can muster, and __to the best I can be__._



# Currently

I specialize in designing, building, and leveraging systems that drive intelligent decisions using an organization's data. Whether in Business Intelligence or Data Science, I enjoy working with data to make measurable, tangible impacts on the company in which I work for.

At the moment, I work as an Analytics Data Engineer at [RevSpring](https://revspringinc.com/), working in the healthcare RCM space. I also work for [Deck of Dice Gaming](https://www.shakeitupdice.com/) in my spare time, and serve as Director of Analytics, supporting both real-time and server-based analytics for their mobile applications, where I design and build systems to drive decisions.


# Some history

I grew up in [Strongsville, Ohio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Strongsville,+OH), which is a suburb directly southwest of Cleveland, Ohio. I attended the wonderful public schools there, and graduated from Strongsville High School in the class of 2014. While growing up, I enjoyed athletics and was involved in both football and baseball throughout most of my childhood and was able to pursue that because of the support from my wonderful parents, Tom and Ginny. I have 2 older siblings, a brother named Connor and a sister named Emmie. As the youngest of three, perhaps my greatest feat was still being my parents favorite despite the long odds.

- I can (sort of) speak some Czech, or better said, Já umím mluvit trochu Česky.
- I have never been able to spell "license" correctly without verifying via spellcheck or google.
- I have a mullet, because 2020. Gives off a real Joe Dirt vibe, but I like going against the grain.
- I have a cat named Cookie. He is a ~6 year old tabby rescue, and follows me around everywhere. Kind of like a furry parrot that can only meow.
