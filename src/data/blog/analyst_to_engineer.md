At the moment I am writing this, I would consider making the leap from analyst to engineer the greatest milestone of my young career. I wanted to take some time and reflect on this experience so its possible that another young professional may learn from my mistakes and achieve their goals as well. 

I found myself at the right place at the right time, and had the chance to really take a swing at an opportunity that many dream of - to lead the development of a production system to operate a trained predictive model. I had been promoted from Reporting Analyst to Analytics Data Engineer on my team, and soon thereafter the team embarked on something none of us knew anything about. From my perspective, the predictive model was the _easy_ part, as every single person on the team had trained a predictive model at some point in their career, as well as having a PhD Statistian on our team to comfront the mathematical complications in that arena. Given our situation and staff, I'll have to admit that I thought the odds of success were much less than that of failure. 

I'd compare it to being thrown out of a plane with nothing but a parachute and the clothes on my back into the Amazon Rain Forest and told to make my way out in less than 3 months. Without a senior engineer within my little corner of the organization to go to, I tried my best to meet with senior IT employees elsewhere around the organization. Unfortunately, they had deadlines just like me and we're as proficient with data and what exactly we were trying to do as they were with different approaches they had built their careers on. This left me out of luck with trying to garner others' expertise, and forced me to turn to the tools I had left in the box: my curiousity and Google.com.

I may not have the typical expensive educational background and natural genious that many of my peers in the data science and analytics field have, but somehow I've found myself in the club of "deployed-a-predictive-model-and-helped-a-company-make-money-off-it" bucket.
