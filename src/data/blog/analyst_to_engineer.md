At the moment I am writing this, I would consider making the leap from analyst to engineer one of the greatest milestones of my young career. I wanted to take some time and reflect on this experience so its possible that another young professional may learn from my mistakes on their journey to achieve their goals as well. I've broken this blog up into a few pieces:
- Where I Was, & How I Got Where I Am Today
- Coping With Failure
- Key Takeaways

## Where I Was, & How I Got Where I Am Today
If I were to be entirely honest, it was difficult for me to find a job after college. I had a knack for acing the first round interview, only to expose my goofy self in the latter interviews. I knew I would be successful in any position I got, but convincing others that you're better than all the other candidates was something that proved difficult for me to accomplish. I would get myself in great position only for my social anxiety to flare up and I'd fumble the ball in the redzone. After graduating without anything lined up, I decided to move back home and continue to pound job sites looking for _anything_ that might offer some potential. Eventually, I found myself deep in the interview process for two separate positions. I drove the 2-hour trip to Columbus, OH from Cleveland, OH on July 3rd, 2018 for an interview. It was over 100 degrees, and there were heat exhaustion warnings for the region, and I just happened to be driving down in my beat-up 2001 Dodge Dakota, which didn't have air conditioning. Hilariously, I actually drove down in an undershirt and shorts, knowing I'd have to change in a parking lot once I got there so I wouldn't show up covered in a soggy, sweat-soaked shirt. I met the folks there, and I was pleasantly surprised with how laid back they were.

I got a call about a week later, informing me that they were extending an offer. The company had awful - and I mean _despicable_ - reviews on glassdoor.com, had a fairly poor location, and the pay was absolutely atrocious. Having been booked for final-round interviews at two companies based in Las Vegas, NV I was sort of torn whether I should accept or try to wait it out and see if I could get something better with the clock ticking down. I asked my father, who is my greatest role model in life, what I should do. He told me, "The general rule is you shouldn't take points off the board", and so I accepted the position that week. I started the next month, on August 6th, 2018.

I found myself in an interesting role. I liked to think of myself as an innovator, but I was in a pretty restricted spot at the start of it all, or at least that's how it felt to me. I picked up creating dashboards pretty quick with the help of my coworker and soon to be friend, Anurag. Soon, It seemed that I could get my job done in about 2-4 hours a day, leaving the rest of the time to really hammer our data warehouse with ridiculous queries for expiremental ideas I had to revolutionize how our company looked at attributing payments to outbound communications. I also strictly stuck with SQL, because I seemed to have an instant, and growing resentment of Base-SAS, having loathed using it from day one. Because I couldn't install my own software, I would often nag about using Python or R instead, since I needed a managers approval, but that was proving a lost cause. I even can vividly recall a time that a week after my company sent another coworker to a SAS conference in Dallas for free (to be fair: the company got 1 free pass, and it was his _turn_, but the company was too cheap to send multiple people there is the issue I have - talk about supporting personal growth!), I spent $450.00 of my own money to go to PyCon US, because it was hosted in Cleveland, OH and I knew I could crash at my parents place! I wasn't making much at the time so that expense was sort of significant, and I made the most of it. I went to every possible meeting and even went by the career fair to see what kind of opportunities I could aim for in a 3-5 year span. I really knew I liked data analytics and wanted to stay in that space, but the question was "How on Earth do I convince someone I'm a Data Scientist?", to which the answer is universally, "more school". 

Here's the thing, I hated school. I think it was the biggest waste of time and money that I could have conceivably made. Maybe it was just my time at Ohio State, where they make it clear you're just a number and give you professors that can't speak English. But, here's the problem from my experience: school doesn't teach _passion_. It beats it out of you like Mike Tyson in a heavyweight boxing match. It irons the fun out of your life, all the while convincing you its worth tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars. There were only 4-6 classes I even thought were worth the price of admission by the end of it. It didn't even help me that much in my job search from my previous experience. So chalk off "Go get my masters degree" for the next 5-10 years (before I inevitably warm up to making that mistake again). That aside, I had a card up my sleeve. I had pretty much taken the Reporting Analyst position for one reason, because I saw an opportunity in the making. The reason the very position had opened up was because another guy had just gotten another job internally in the data engineering team. I saw that, and knew that if I kept my head down working with the data that I would have my opportunity. Eventually, that opportunity came.

I found myself at the right place at the right time, and had the chance to really take a swing at an opportunity that many dream of - to lead the development of a production system to operate a trained predictive model. Again, to be honest I'd use "lead" loosely, because really it was just me frantically trying to put the model our statistician trained into a production system. I had been promoted from Reporting Analyst to Analytics Data Engineer on my team, and soon thereafter the team embarked on something none of us knew anything about. From my perspective, the predictive model was the _easy_ part, because every single person on the team had trained a predictive model at some point in their career, on top of having a PhD Statistician on our team to confront the mathematical complications in that arena. Given our situation and our staff, I'll have to admit that I thought the odds of success were much less than that of failure. Once I found out that I had to build an API that could adequately handle the load, matching that currently sent to a very competent vender, I just about threw the white flag up right then and there. It was a pretty hilarious situation looking back at it...

I'd compare it to being thrown out of a plane with nothing but a parachute and the clothes on my back into the Amazon Rain Forest and told to make my way out in less than 3 months. Without a senior engineer, or anyone technical in a senior position above me for that matter, I'll have to admit that my manager was a little bold to encourage me, nonetheless trust me, to get the job done. It was an incredible risk, but one that ultimately worked out for the both of us - otherwise there wouldn't be anything to write about! Without having anyone within my little corner of the organization to go to, I tried my best to meet with senior IT employees elsewhere around the organization. Unfortunately, they too had stressful deadlines, and weren't as proficient with data and what exactly we were trying to do as they were with the different approaches they had built their careers on. This left me out of luck with trying to garner others' expertise, and forced me to turn to the tools I had left in the box: my curiosity, tenacity, and Google.com.

Brick-by-brick, I was able to lay a foundation. After hours upon hours of extra work and overtime, I fealt like I was on my way. Looking back, I would definitely say there was a tipping point where things just seemed easier, like I had a grip on what I was doing for once. First, I figured out configurations. Next, the API routing and services. Finally, the database connections and the predictive models. After ~3 long months I had found myself in a unique club, but it wasn't without cost or difficulties along the way. I faced that sink or swim moment, and admittingly, I felt like I sometimes had a 15lb rock weighing me down as waves crashed me every which way. Somehow, I stayed above the water and accomplished my dream.



## Coping With Failure
There were _a lot_ of times I didn't get something right the first time around. As I write this, I'd chalk up the project as a whole as a success, but there were certainly times things didn't go as planned. In retrospect, I'd say the perserverence can be attributed to staying calm in the face of adversity and incredible stress. I failed on so many things that its hard to recount a particular time, but a few things pop out at me today:

- It took me about 2-4 weeks to fully understand how configurations & secrets worked
- I'm guessing it took me around 150-250 docker builds to finally "get it"
- I already re-wrote the entire API (lol)

During the project, I had so much pressure on me that I had developed some sort of anxiety-driven issue where I started to struggle with breathing (and I'm not talking about the coronavirus).I'd describe it as a sort of shortness of breathe where it feels like you need to yawn, or like you just can't get a full breath, you might understand how that affects your day-to-day life. I bring this up, because I want to fully illustrate that it wasn't all mountain tops and daisies. It was hard work... challenging both my mind and my sanity. My desire for success had pushed me past yesterday's qualifying race and into the main heats, but the pressure dissipates in a sort of apathy and thick skin you grow through past failures. It now comes and goes now with the continued stress due to the constant maddening drum beat of tech debt and upstream decisions made by folks who may or may not fully understand how subtle intricacies affect my ability to get things done.

Just remember nothing is worth more than your happiness, your health, and those you love. Not data science, not money, and certainly not organizational clout. I'll admit that while I am super passionate about data science and my work, one of the reasons I worked so hard was that I simply didn't have anything _better_ to do with my time. I simply ranked, and still do rank continuous learning in my top 5 things in life. I'm somewhat thankful for that, because its gotten me where I am today. I just want to stress that its important to keep all your first things first. Yes, you can get there through hard work, but don't sacrifice anything you would regret. It's important to consider this all before diving in, because there are "sink or swim" moments, and if you want to swim you need to assure that you are surrounded by the right environment to do so. Whether that's being a lone wolf like I was, or if you would thrive more in a structured team following more educational qualification then you know that's the route for you - and there's nothing wrong with that. Everyone learns differently, and its important to fully understand yourself before attempting to understand any data.

## Key Takeaways
I may not have the typical expensive educational background and natural genius that many of my peers in the data science and analytics field have, but somehow I've found myself in the club of "deployed-a-predictive-model-and-helped-a-company-make-money-off-it" bucket.
